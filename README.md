A mobile application designed to help millennials manage their finances through their smartphones. This project originated from a problem where many millennials are lazy to record finances manually, so their finances are not well managed. The Fiman application comes as a solution by providing easy-to-use tools for financial recording and management. To achieve the goal, this project requires a thorough business process analysis using various system design methodologies through Activity Diagram, Usecase Diagram, Domain Model, State Machine, Usecase Description, System Sequence Diagram, and CRUD Usecase. By following this structured approach, the Fiman project succeeded in designing a financial management system that fulfils user needs and is fit for purpose.
