A mobile application designed to help millennials manage their finances through smartphones. This project originated from a problem where many millennials are lazy to record finances manually, so that their finances are not well managed. The Fiman app comes as a solution by providing an easy-to-use tool for financial recording and management. To achieve this goal, this project requires business process analysis by creating a system design diagram. By doing so, the Fiman project succeeded in designing a financial management system that meets user needs and is fit for purpose.
